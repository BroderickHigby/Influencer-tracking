CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT PORTAL

The idea of the campaign management portal is to provide businesses and brands with a more interactive, nuanced, and direct way to
advertise their products and brand to social media influencers. Instead of requiring clients to know and input what kind of
influencers they want to search for, they can instead provide what they wish to accomplish with a campaign and let Sapie Space
connect them with the best influencers and put together the most effective campaign.

This portal will manifest itself in a page that lets users input a bunch of information about what they want to accomplish VS
just showing them a generic search field.

Basic Ideas for the Portal UI:

Core:
campaign_goal: brand_awareness || sell_products || drive_digital_traffic || drive_physical_traffic
brand/product_industries: skating || beauty || tennis || ........
target_url:
copy_to_use: text/images/clips/words they want used in the promotions.
target_social_media_platforms: youtube || twitch || instagram || snapchat ....
budget:

Demographics:
promotion_location: city/cities || state/states || whole country ||
promotion_ages: any_range(s) || none


When the client hits Submit after filling out the above form:

A series of influencers are displayed to them in a list with key metrics of each influencer like what social media they are active
on, followers/influencer rating, cost of plug, engagement metrics, as well as match scores for how well their audience matches
demographics specified by our client.

The client can remove influencers or add influencers to this default list.

Can do final tweaking to campaign before they start - we then contact influencers on their behalf and provide a campaign management
portal.
