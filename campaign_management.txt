CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT PORTAL

The idea of the campaign management portal is to provide businesses and brands with a more interactive, nuanced, and direct way to
advertise their products and brand to social media influencers. Instead of requiring clients to know and input what kind of
influencers they want to search for, they can instead provide what they wish to accomplish with a campaign and let Sapie Space
connect them with the best influencers and put together the most effective campaign.

This portal will manifest itself in a page that lets users input a bunch of information about what they want to accomplish VS
just showing them a generic search field.

Basic Ideas for the Portal UI:

Core:
campaign_goal: brand_awareness || sell_products || drive_digital_traffic || drive_physical_traffic
brand/product_industries: skating || beauty || tennis || ........
target_url:
copy_to_use: text/images/clips/words they want used in the promotions.
target_social_media_platforms: youtube || twitch || instagram || snapchat ....
budget:

Demographics:
promotion_location: city/cities || state/states || whole country ||
promotion_ages: any_range(s) || none


When the client hits Submit after filling out the above form:

A series of influencers are displayed to them in a list with key metrics of each influencer like what social media they are active
on, followers/influencer rating, cost of plug, engagement metrics, as well as match scores for how well their audience matches
demographics specified by our client.

The client can remove influencers or add influencers to this default list.

Can do final tweaking to campaign before they start - we then contact influencers on their behalf and provide a campaign management
portal.

Set up urls that link to client target url that use google analytics and cookies to track interests, demographics, social media, etc.




clients fill out the create campaign form. this gets written to the db as a campaign object

then on the backend we rate/match a ton of influencers first with a fake model then with a real model as we gather data from doing this and reach out automatically to a large group of influencers are models say match the inputs they gave in the create campaign form.
once a few influencers respond and agree to run the plugs the campaign status goes active, all of this is show in the campaign management portal.
whenever a conversion on the campaign happens from the influencer plug (link click, or product purchased) this gets written to the campaign object variable called results, a datetime list that just shows how many conversion it has had and when they took place
once the campaign ends (by budget or time) we automatically send the client a full report of the campaign (and make it available in the history section of the campaign management portal), and we then retrain our models using this new campaign as an input and switch the status of the campaign to ended.
^ that is the summary, i think it could all be done automatically, even the reaching out to influencers tbh without too much work
and this is what i was thinking for a campaign object: (basically the info we would need them to give us in the form):
